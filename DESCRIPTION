Description: The MFLDA package provides functions for performing Multivariate Functional Linear Discriminant Analysis. This method extends traditional linear discriminant analysis to functional data, enabling the classification of multivariate observations represented as curves. By incorporating sparsity, MFLDA identifies the most relevant features while efficiently handling high-dimensional data. The package is designed for users seeking to analyze complex functional and longitudinal data with multiple predictors to gain insights into underlying patterns and relationships.
