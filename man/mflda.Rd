\usage{
mflda(
  Xtrain = Xtrain,
  Y = Y,
  Tau = Tau,
  Xtestdata = Xtestdata,
  Ytest = Ytest,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{Xtrain}{A data frame containing the training data with features and identifiers. The first three columns should be identifiers, and subsequent columns should be features.}

\item{Y}{A vector of class labels for the training data, corresponding to the rows in `Xtrain`.}

\item{Tau}{Regularization parameter for sLDA; determines the sparsity of the resulting discriminant functions.}

\item{Xtestdata}{A data frame containing the test data, structured similarly to `Xtrain`. If NULL, training data is used for testing.}

\item{Ytest}{A vector of class labels for the test data. Required if `Xtestdata` is provided.}

\item{plotIt}{A logical indicating whether to plot the discriminants and densities. Default is FALSE.}

\item{standardize}{A logical indicating whether to standardize the training and test data standardized to have mean zero and variance one for each time point and each variable. Default is TRUE.}

\item{maxiteration}{Maximum number of iterations for convergence in optimization. Default is 20.}

\item{thresh}{Convergence threshold for the optimization algorithm. Default is 1e-03.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \item{AverageError}{Average error of the classification.}
  \item{Metrics}{A vector of classification performance metrics (accuracy, balanced accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and Matthews correlation coefficient).}
  \item{TimeSpecificError}{Error for the test data classified based on the provided time points.}
  \item{hatalpha}{Estimated coefficients from the sLDA model.}
  \item{PredictedClass}{Predicted class labels for the test data.}
  \item{myDiscPlot}{Plot object of discriminants and densities, if `plotIt` is TRUE.}
  \item{Projection.df}{Data frame of projected values for visualization.}

\description{
This function performs Multivariate Functional Linear Discriminant Analysis (MFLDA) for classification of multi-class data. It trains the model on provided training data, optionally standardizes the data, and evaluates performance on test data.
}
\details{
This function implements the MFLDA algorithm by performing the following steps:
1. Checks and preprocesses the data.
2. Optionally standardizes the data.
3. Performs the iterative optimization to obtain the discriminant functions.
4. Classifies the test data based on the learned discriminant functions.
5. Computes various performance metrics and generates plots if requested.

# Example usage of mflda function:
result <- mflda(Xtrain = train_data, Y = train_labels, Tau = 0.5,
                 Xtestdata = test_data, Ytest = test_labels,
                 plotIt = TRUE, standardize = TRUE)

# Access predicted classes and performance metrics
predicted_classes <- result$PredictedClass
performance_metrics <- result$Metrics
